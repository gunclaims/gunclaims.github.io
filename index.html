<p>There is a tendency for those in the firearms community (aka "gun
community", aka "second amendment community," etc.) to adopt certain
sacred cows.</p>
<p>One such sacred cow is the idea that you need to <em>purchase</em> a D spring for
your new Beretta 92.  This is accepted, unchallenged, as gospel and
could not be farther from the truth.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, it is not in dispute that the "D" spring improves the heavy
factory/stock trigger of the Beretta 92 by shaving a couple of pounds
off of the double action and the single action.  It really does make a
difference, and is very easy to do.</p>
<p>However, <strong>what is a D spring and how can I get one?</strong> This
turns out to be an interesting question.</p>
<p>The general advice I see usually is to fork over some cash for a D
spring.  For example, <a href="https://www.berettausa.com/en-us/beretta-92-96-steel-trigger-spring-trigger-and-d-hammer-spring/e00691/">here is
one</a>
from Beretta USA for $25 (this includes a metal trigger and extra
trigger spring).  Beretta USA wised up and hasn't sold the standalone
92 D spring for ages.  Adding in tax and shipping means a nearly $40
"investment."</p>
<p>Brownells also <a href="https://www.brownells.com/handgun-parts/trigger-group-parts/hammer-parts/hammer-springs/hammer-spring-d-version-prod27930.aspx">sells
them</a>,
for $3.50 + tax and shipping at the time of this writing.  Prices vary.
I have paid up to $8 for them from Brownells in the past.</p>
<h3>What is a "D" Spring?</h3>

<p>A 92 D spring is simply a shorter hammer spring.  The hammer spring is the
part of the gun that controls how difficult it is to pull the trigger,
both in double action and single action mode.  It is part number 38 in
the following diagram:</p>
<p><img class='materialboxed' width=400 src=https://imgur.com/2iPIlhy.jpg></p>
<p>A stouter/longer spring means a heavier trigger pull, and a
slimmer/shorter spring means a lighter trigger pull.</p>
<p>The D spring is simply a lighter spring than the factory spring.  In
addition to the factory spring (i.e., the one that comes installed in a
new 92) and the D spring, you can also get really fancy and purchase all
kinds of different poundage weights from Wilson Combat, Wolff Springs,
and others.</p>
<p>For this discussion, we're sticking with the D spring.</p>
<p>What is the actual diffence between the factory spring and the D spring?</p>
<h4>A DIY Digression</h4>

<p>I have collected a lot of Beretta 92s through the years.  I'm a big fan
of the platform, helped along by the fact that my first gun as shown
above was a gorgeous Italian-made 92FS.  But there came a day when I got
a new 92 and could not find a D spring to go in it.  Ordering one would
take at least a week.  Having changed out many D springs over the years,
I knew that the factory spring and D spring aren't all that different.
But I wondered, just how different are they?</p>
<p>To test this, I took the D spring out of another gun and compared it to
the factory spring in the new 92.  Indeed, the D spring was just a bit
shorter.  So I cut the factory spring down with a dremel, which took
about 30 seconds, and guess what?  <strong>It worked perfectly.</strong></p>
<blockquote>So I cut the factory spring down with a dremel, which took

</blockquote>

<p>So for some time now, I have known that <em>you can make a D spring from a
factory spring by just gently cutting it down.</em>  How much to cut though?
It so happened that I had two factory springs and two D springs.  I
measured them, and I think the results speak for themselves:</p>
<p><img class='materialboxed' width=800 src='https://i.imgur.com/6fRy61v.jpg?2'></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Spring</th><th>Length (inches)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Factory #1</td><td>2.625</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Factory #2</td><td>2.5965</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D #1</td><td>2.378</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D #2</td><td>2.375</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>That's it!  A factory spring is approximately 2.6 inches long, and a
D spring is approximately 2.4 inches long.  So, the next time you need a
D spring, don't spend $25 or even $8.  Just break out that dremel, wire
snips, or blowtorch, and knock .2 inches of that bad boy.  Never buy a D
spring again.</p>

<p>In a future posting, I might cut more than the .2 off and see if I still
have a functioning pistol, and I might also do some testing with my
trigger pull gauges to see how removing another tenth of an inch or more
makes any difference to the pull weight.</p>
<p>Happy shooting, and as always, keep <a href="/firearm-safety.html">safety considerations</a> in mind.</p>
